## Description: 
		
  So far, I have trained two models of gender and emotion these training was made by using online reference and my own knowledge. 
    
   1. The Other two models are trained by using the same methods with some different proportions. 
    
   2. I have taken the datasets and trained and also tested my models. The accuracy is depend on epoche for training and strong datasets

### Gender:

   1. For this I had used a datasets of man’s and woman’s faces and trained using the program Train.py.⋅⋅
	  	
   2. By running train.py it will create a gender_detection.model weight file. Based on epoche it will trained as well as high accuracy.
      
   3. The training process time is done based on computer hardware and processor speed.
      
   4. After creation of weight file now run the detect_gender.py program it will loaded and shoots your webcame and works properly.
      
   5. Make sure the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml contains in the gender folder because I didn’t gave on gender file.

### Emotion: 
 		
   1. For emotions I’ve extracted the given dataset containing 120 images and extracted the metadata and pixels of the images and labelled with (0..6)  in .CSV file.
 		
   2. By running the training.py it will trained and create .hdf5 file as output.
 		
   3. Based on the epoche it was trained as high as accuracy  and time depend upon the hardware config of your machine.
		
   4. Finally running the recog test.py it wil work as much as high accuracy.
    
    
    The other implementation process is on process of my giving best solution.
    
    I have learned lot about this field. By that I have give my best.
